**Speakerâ€™s Name:** Kevin Cain

**Assignment Name** Self-Introductory Speech

**Introduction** 

**Attention getter:** "I've gone by a lot of different names in my life. My friends call me John, my family calls me Ricky. For the almost 8 years of my life between both the Army and the Fire Department, I was called Schnaubelt, which is my last name. And honestly Schnaubelt is what I'm most familiar with, and its a terrible name!"

**Name:** "My name is Kevin Cain, and I feel like my life is an ever changing Odyssey."

**Thesis/Preview of main points:** I've been to a lot of different places and seen a lot of different things. `And am going nowhere in a hurry.`

**Transition:** "I left the burning city of troy that was my childhood, and started my journey in the Army."

**Body** 

1.	The Army taught me how to breathe / fundamentals i had missed in childhood.
  a.	I had never done laundry before.
    I. We were in the transition phase of basic that's before you actually get to your basic training unit, and I had amassed laundry to do.
    i.	I found myself in a situation where I had to do laundry for the first time in my life, and through some unknowable thought process, I reasoned I should seek the advice of the older gentleman that had been making frequent advances towards me.
    iii.	He explained how to separate the colors from the whites, and how and when to use different temperatures and settings. He even gave me a tip to use the dirty dry laundry to wipe clean the detergent cap.
    iv.	Currently I throw all my laundry in together, eyeball pour the detergent directly into the drum, and wash everything on normal cold.

**Transition:** But the Army not only gave me some burgeoning life skills, it also gave me a sense of purpose, and I had never had that before.

1.	I was a medic, and I was good at it.
a.	When I tried to join the Army, I wanted to be an infantryman.
i.	I had gone to Military Entrance Processing Stations several times, and each time a new reason would come up why I couldn't join.
ii.	This time, too skinny. This time, color blind. This time, the system was down.
b.	Eventually, the option that was always on the list was 'medic' and I thought, "sure, why not?"
i.	The most I had known about Army medics was from the video game 'Battlefield' where you defibrillate (I called it 'defibulate') your fellow team mates to miraculously raise them from the dead, like some kind of camouflaged Lazarus. 
ii.	I took to 68W Health Care Specialist like moth to the flame.

**Transition:** This would only be the beginning of my Odyssey.

1.	Odd jobs and the Fire Department
a.	I took a job working a flower shop, as it seemed the most logical follow up to Army Medic.
i.	I delivered flowers in Jacksonville Florida.
ii.	I won't tell you how I ended up in Jacksonville Florida. Like most residents of Jacksonville, we kind of just washed along the shore.
iii.	Fortunately, the lady of the local flower shop was Austrian, and couldn't help but be smitten by my last name.
iv.	She used to tell me how she took pots, flowers, dirt, water, and faux grass, all of which total in the neighborhood of 10 cents, and sell it all together for $50. 
b.	Eventually I would decide I wanted purpose again, and enrolled in the Fire Academy of Jacksonville
i.	I would finish the academy and find myself back to one of my many weary homes in Beaufort SC.
ii.	I would join the City of Beaufort/ Town of Port Royal fire department, January 2019, and go through the COVID-19 pandemic as a first responder.

**Transition:** I'm a programmer now, with a wife and daughter.

**Conclusion** 

**Thesis restatement/Review/Summary:** My life has been a crazy odyssey that doesn't show any signs of stopping.

**Clincher/WOW Statement:** The odyssey of my life doesn't really seem to end, but this speech is over, so thank you for listening.
