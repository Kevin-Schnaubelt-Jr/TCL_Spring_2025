    <h3><u>GAMER and FATHER</u></h3>

    <p>
        Kevin is a <strong><em><u>GAMER</u></em></strong>. 
        This means he plays <strong>video games</strong>.
        Considering it's impossible to make ahobby of computer games not sound infantile and trite,
        i won't even try. Kevin is also a father, which is much more respectable.
