            <h2>Do Air Conditioners "Make Cold?"</h2>
            <p>
                Contrary to conventional wisdom, AC units don't actually "make cold." Technically they only really "produce" heat, which is hilariously ironically, but that's because most 
                machines with moving parts and or electronics produce heat as a byproduct of being a machine. Air conditioners are more accurately described as "heat pumps." They have a 
                fluid inside that goes through an exothermic reaction on one end, and an endothermic reaction on the other, effectively stealing the heat from the air inside and moving it 
                outside! In warmer countries where the air outside isn't exceedingly cold in the winter, the same AC unit simply runs in reverse to pump heat from the outside air, in!
